# Manga Scripts

## Tachiyomi Extensions

Scripts starting with tachi.

These scripts are not tachiyomi extensions in the traditional sense as they're not
apps that work with tachiyomi but they can be used to download chapters.

To be used with termux.

Placing a script inside `~/.shortcuts` folder of termux is a good way to use
these scripts.

One may also have a cron job setup to run these scripts at the chapter release
time.
