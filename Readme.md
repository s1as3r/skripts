# Skripts

Skripts go skrrrrrt!

Badly written scripts that I use(d) sometimes.

Some of these scipts might have become obsolete at some point and might not work.

## Usage

Before running a script make sure to install it's dependencies.

Most of these scripts are writeen in python so, usually it's done by just running `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside its folder.

If it's a bash script or a script written in some other lang, refer the readme or look around inside the script itself.

To get the exact usage instructions of a script, refer to the readme of the respsctive script.
